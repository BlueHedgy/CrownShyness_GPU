Things to potentially look into:
- Limit connections per point braching (to achieve e.g binary trees, alternate branching)
- Edge connection should be angle aware with the above constraint (else the branches just go everywhere)
- Change branch styling to angle dependent, not edge length dependent
- Maybe affect by a pseudo gravitational function ?
