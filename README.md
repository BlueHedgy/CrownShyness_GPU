Some few lines about how all these work:

## How to compile and run:
- Using terminal, navigate to code and run the following commands:
```console
    cd code
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake --build .

```

- Using Visual Studio Code (vscode)
    - Install cmake extension
    - simply click build and then run on the bottom left of the screen (extension's functionality)

## The code uses a config file as input
- config.json is located in config folder
- setup multiple profiles and load them by name in the console while running

By default a ***graph.obj*** file will be generated upon running the compiled file inside the **bin** folder in the top directory.

You can open and view the output via 3d softwares such as Blender, Maya, 3DSMax, etc...
